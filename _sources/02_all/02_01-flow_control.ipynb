    "# Part 1. Algorithm and Flow control with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithms and flowcharts\n",
    "Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving a problem. They are essential in computer science and programming, as they provide a clear set of instructions for performing tasks or computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before writing any code, it is important to define the logic of your program. A good initial step when developing code is planning and structuring the logic before with a scheme or a flow chart. This involves thinking about the specific operations and functions you will need to implement, as well as the initial data required, and what the expected outputs will be. \n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithms are the backbone of programming, as they define how a program operates and processes data. The more complex the task, the more important it is to have a well-defined algorithm to ensure that the program functions correctly and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a general rule, an algorithm should be:\n",
    "- Clear and unambiguous: Each step should be precisely defined.\n",
    "- Finite: It should have a clear starting and ending point.\n",
    "- Effective: Each step should be feasible and executable.\n",
    "- Input and Output: It should have defined inputs and outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand that an algorithm is not tied to a specific programming language; rather, it is a conceptual framework that can be implemented in various languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "`````{admonition} Tip\n",
    ":class: tip\n",
    "A good practise is to first think :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How your physical system is defined.  Which are the characteristics of your system (eg, dimensionality, interconnections,  ...) \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Then which will be initial data you need to start from (for instance, which variables you will need to define, in which units, transformations you will need to apply, which data you will need to read from external files, ...),\n",
    "\n",
    "3. and finally, which are the expected outputs (which are the outcomes, simulation trajectories, units in which they will be expressed, format of the data, if you will need to export it to an external file, ...).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have done taht, you can start developing which operations, functions or methods you will need to implement in order to get your expected output. \n",
    "\n",
    "I strongly suggest to write a very basic logic scheme (e.g., a flowchart or a list of steps) to help you plan how the analysis needs to be perform, and how to code it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very likely that you will modify this scheme as you progress through the problem-solving process. But at least you will have a starting point to work from with a defined structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you get familiar with programming, you will be able to do this step mentally, but at the beginning it is very useful to write it down.\n",
    "`````\n",
    "\n",
    "Flowcharts are extremely useful to visualize the steps of an algorithm, for both in the initial planning stages and once it has been implemented. \n",
    "\n",
    "Flowcharts use standardized symbols to represent different types of actions or steps in a process, and arrows to indicate the flow of control from one step to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common flowchart symbols:\n",
    "- **Terminator**: Represents the start or end of a process. It is usually depicted as an oval or rounded rectangle.\n",
    "- **Process**: Represents a process or operation to be performed. It is typically shown as a rectangle.\n",
    "- **Decision**: Represents a decision point that can lead to different branches based on a condition. It is usually depicted as a diamond shape.\n",
    "- **Input/Output**: Represents an input or output operation, such as reading data or displaying results.\n",
    "- **Arrow**: Indicates the flow of control from one step to another.\n",
    "- **Connector**: Represents a connection point in the flowchart, often used to connect different parts of the chart or to indicate a jump to another section.\n",
    "- **Loop**: Represents a loop or iteration in the process, often shown as a circular arrow or a rectangle with a curved arrow.\n",

    "## 1.1 Indenting\n",
    "Python is known for its readability and simplicity. It is actually achieved because it employs indentation as a core aspect of its syntax to define these structures. It is basically in which order, instructions will be executed. An important aspect in Python is that it uses indentation to define blocks of code, which is crucial for maintaining the structure and flow of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indentation is a key feature in Python since it denotes blocks of code that belong together, such as the body of a function, loop, or conditional statement. In contrast to many other programming languages that use curly braces `{}` or keywords to define blocks of code, Python relies on indentation levels to indicate the grouping of statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can either use tabs or spaces for indentation, but it is important to be consistent throughout your code. Mixing tabs and spaces can lead to errors that are difficult to debug.\n",
    "As a standard convention in the Python community, it is recommended to use 4 spaces per indentation level. A good trick to maintain consistency is to configure your text editor or IDE to insert 4 spaces when you press the Tab key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples :\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if a == b:\n",
    "    # first level of indentation (within if statement)\n",
    "    for x in range(y):\n",
    "        # second level of indenting (within for loop and if statement)\n",
    "        if x > a:\n",
    "            # third level of indenting (within if statement within for loop\n",
    "            # within outer if statement)\n",
    "            ...\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of these three examples is right, and which one is wrong? \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = True\n",
    "if x is True:\n",
    "print(\"x is True\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if x is True:\n",
    "  print(\"x is True\")\n",
    "    print(\"...or is it!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if x is True:\n",
    "    print(\"x is True\")\n",
    "    print(\"...or is it!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two examples are wrong because they do not maintain consistent indentation levels. The first example lacks indentation for the print statement, and the second example has inconsistent indentation levels for the two print statements. The third example is correct because it maintains consistent indentation levels for both print statements within the `if` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a more complete example of indentation, have a look at the different blocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_function(a):\n",
    "    # first level of indentation\n",
    "    x = range(a)\n",
    "    y = []\n",
    "    for i in x:\n",
    "        # second level of indentation\n",
    "        y.append(i * 2 + 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # back to first level of indenting (i.e., outside the for loop, but still in the function definition)\n",
    "    return y\n",
    "\n",
    "# back outside the function definition\n",
    "b = my_function(10)\n",
    "print(b)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Conditional statements: if, elif, else\n",
    "Conditional statements are used to execute different blocks of code *based on certain conditions*. The most common conditional statements are `if`, `elif`, and `else`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before using conditional statements, it is important to understand boolean expressions. A boolean expression is an expression that evaluates to either `True` or `False`. These expressions are often used in conditional statements to determine which block of code should be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements are based on conditions that evaluate to either `True` or `False` based on conditionaal expressions. \n",
    "Some conditional expressions include:\n",
    "- Equality: `==`\n",
    "- Inequality: `!=`\n",
    "- Greater than: `>`\n",
    "- Less than: `<`\n",
    "- Greater than or equal to: `>=`\n",
    "- Less than or equal to: `<=`   \n",
    "- Membership: `in`, `not in`\n",
    "- Identity: `is`, `is not`\n",
    "- Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`\n",
    "- Bitwise operators: `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`\n",
    "- Ternary conditional operator: `a if condition else b`\n",
    "- Chained comparisons: `a < b < c`\n",
    "- Lambda functions: `lambda x: x > 0`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, you can use an `if` statement to check if a variable is greater than a certain value, and execute a block of code if the condition is `True`. You can also use `elif` (short for \"else if\") to check multiple conditions, and `else` to execute a block of code if none of the previous conditions are `True`.\n",
    "Here is an example of using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "if x > 0:\n",
    "    print(\"x is positive\")\n",
    "elif x < 0:\n",
    "    print(\"x is negative\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"x is zero\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### If Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "if x > 0:\n",
    "    print(\"x is positive\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "This code checks if `x` is greater than 0. This loops are based on boolean operations, either if something is true or false. If the condition is `True`, it prints \"x is positive\". "

These constructs are fundamental for creating dynamic and responsive programs that can make decisions and repeat actions based on certain conditions. An important note is to keep the indentation consistent, as it defines each block of code in your Python program.\n"
