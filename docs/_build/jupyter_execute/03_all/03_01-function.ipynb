    "# Part 1: Functions and Lambda Functions \n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, we will explore functions and lambda functions in Python. Functions are blocks of code, fundamental in programming, that perform specific tasks and can be reused throughout a program. **They help in organizing code, improving readability, and reducing redundancy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define our own functions to encapsulate logic and operations, making our code modular and easier to maintain. It is also very common to use **Lambda functions for short, throwaway functions that are not reused elsewhere in the code**. Lambda functions are a way to create small, anonymous functions in a single line of code on the fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Regular function\n",
    "def add(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b    \n",
    "print(add(2, 3))  # Output: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "# Lambda function\n",
    "add_lambda = lambda a, b: a + b\n",
    "print(add_lambda(2, 3))  # Output: 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference in syntax between functions and lambda functions is that functions are defined in blocks of code, starting with the `def` keyword and can contain multiple expressions and statements. While lambda functions are usually one single line of code, they are defined using the `lambda` keyword and can only contain a single expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Defining Regular Functions\n",
    "Functions are **blocks of reusable code** designed to perform a specific task, which you can call and reuse in different parts of the code, as many times as you need. They help in **breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces**. They allow for **modularity and reusability**. \n",
    "\n",
    "They are useful to **compactify code**. Rather than writing 20 lines of code to do a specific task with certain values for the variables used, instead we define a function that we can call with different arguments and use it multiple times. They also help in **improving code readability**, by giving meaningful names to blocks of code, making it easier to understand what the code does at a glance, and **consistency**, by avoiding code duplication and potential mistakes of typos, variable names, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you remember from last week, algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving a problem. Functions can be thought of as a way to implement pieces of an algorithm in the code, connected through control flow structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Many programming languages, including Python, have built-in functions that perform common tasks. Examples: `print()`, `len()`, and `type()`. You can also import functions from libraries and modules to extend the functionality of your code as we will see in the next session.\n",
    "\n",
    "However they also allow you to define your own functions, where you can define entirely its behavior, arguments, and return values. Which is the main potential of computer programming.\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.1 Function Syntax\n",
    "In Python, a function is defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the **function name, parentheses `()`, and a colon `:`**. Remember the importance of syntax and indentation. The function body always needs to be indented below the definition line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Definition of functions always in the beginning of the code\n",
    "def function_name([parameters]):\n",
    "    <block>\n",
    "    [return <expression>]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling the function somewhere else in the code\n",
    "function_name([arguments])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "There is a subtle difference between **parameters** and **arguments**: Parameters are the variables defined in the function definition, while arguments are the actual values passed to the function when it is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(a, b):  # a and b are parameters\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "result = add(5, 3)  # 5 and 3 are arguments\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note a few things:\n",
    "- The function name should be descriptive and follow standard naming conventions (lowercase letters and underscores).\n",
    "- Parameters are optional. A function can have zero or more parameters.\n",
    "- The `return` statement is also optional. If a function does not have a return statement, it returns `None` by default.\n",
    "- **Indentation** is crucial in Python, as it defines the scope of the function body.\n",
    "- Functions are called by their name, followed by parentheses, and you can pass arguments to the function if it has parameters.\n",
    "- Functions can be defined anywhere in your code, but they **must be defined before they are called**. A common practice is to define functions at the beginning of your script or module.\n",
    "- Functions can be nested, meaning you can define a function inside another function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.2 Function Arguments\n",
    "As we have seen, functions can take arguments, which are values passed to the function when it is called. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of arguments:\n",
    "- **Positional Arguments**: The most common type, where the order of arguments matters. In the function definition, parameters are defined in a specific order, separated by commas. When calling the function, you **must provide arguments in the same order** as the parameters were defined. Also the number of arguments must match the number of parameters defined in the function.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Syntax : \n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def function_name(param1, param2):\n",
    "        <block>\n",
    "\n",
    "    function_name(arg1, arg2)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Keyword Arguments**: Arguments that are passed by explicitly specifying the parameter name. When calling a function, you can specify the parameter names along with their corresponding values. This allows you to pass arguments in any order, as long as you specify the parameter names. Still, the number of arguments must match the number of parameters defined in the function.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Syntax of keyword arguments: \n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def function_name(param1, param2):\n",
    "        <block>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    function_name(param2=arg2, param1=arg1)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Default Arguments**: Arguments that assume a default value if a value is not provided. In this case, when defining the function, you can give default values to parameters. When calling the function, if you do not provide a value for that parameter, the default value will be used. If a value is provided, it overrides the default value. **Default arguments must come after positional arguments in the function definition**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Syntax: \n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def function_name(param1, param2=default_value):\n",
    "        <block>\n",
    "\n",
    "    function_name(arg1)  # Uses default value for param2\n",
    "    function_name(arg1, arg2)  # Overrides default value for param2\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variable-length Arguments**: Arguments that allow you to pass a variable number of arguments to a function.\n",
    "    We use  `*args` for non-keyword variable-length arguments and `**kwargs` for keyword variable-length arguments. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Syntax:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def function_name(*args):\n",
    "        <block>\n",
    "\n",
    "    def function_name(**kwargs):\n",
    "        <block>\n",
    "\n",
    "    function_name(arg1, arg2, arg3)  # For *args\n",
    "    function_name(key1=value1, key2=value2)  # For **kwargs\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "From the following examples, which type of arguments is being used?\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def calculate_area(length, width):\n",
    "    return length * width\n",
    "\n",
    "area = calculate_area(5, 3)\n",
    "print(area)  # Output: 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def introduce(name, age):\n",
    "    print(f\"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "introduce(age=25, name=\"Alice\") # Output: My name is Alice and I am 25 years old.\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def sum_all(*args):\n",
    "    return sum(args)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling the function\n",
    "total = sum_all(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "print(total)  # Output: 15\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling again the function with different number of arguments\n",
    "total_kwargs = sum_all(10, 20, 30)\n",
    "print(total_kwargs)  # Output: 60\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(name, message=\"Hello\"):\n",
    "    print(f\"{message}, {name}!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "greet(\"Alice\") # Uses default message \"Hello\"\n",
    "greet(\"Bob\", \"Hi\") # Overrides default message with \"Hi\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "The order matters:\n",
    "\n",
    "When defining a function, you can use a combination of different types of arguments. However, there are some rules to follow in the order of arguments:\n",
    "  1. **Positional arguments** must come before keyword arguments.\n",
    "  2. **Keyword arguments** must come before default arguments.\n",
    "  3. **Default arguments** must come after positional and keyword arguments.\n",
    "  4. **Variable-length arguments** must come last in the function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a function definition with all types of arguments:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def example_function(pos1, pos2, kwarg1=None, kwarg2=None, default1=10, default2=20, *args, **kwargs):\n",
    "    <block>\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.3 Functions Returning a Value\n",
    "In order to save the output of a function, the common method is the `return` statement. It can be used or not in a function, depending on whether you want to use the output of the function later in your code or not.\n",
    "Technical detail, if there is no `return` statement is used, the function returns `None` by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a function that returns a value:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of a function that returns a value\n",
    "def add(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "result = add(5, 3)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a function that does not return a value:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of a function that returns None\n",
    "def add(a, b):\n",
    "    print(a + b)\n",
    "\n",
    "add(5, 3)\n",
    "result = add(5, 3) # result will be None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If then you try to print `result`, it will print `None` because the function does not return anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.4 Functions Returning Multiple Values\n",
    "Functions can also return multiple values by separating them with commas. The returned values are packed into a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of a function that returns multiple values\n",
    "def get_coordinates():\n",
    "    x = 10\n",
    "    y = 20\n",
    "    return x, y\n",
    "\n",
    "x, y = get_coordinates()\n",
    "print(x, y)  # Output: 10 20 \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can unpack the returned tuple into specific individual variables, as shown in the example above. Or you can also assign the returned tuple to a single variable and access the values using indexing.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "coords = get_coordinates()\n",
    "print(coords)  # Output: (10, 20) \n",
    "print(\"x = \", coords[0], \", y = \", coords[1]) # Output: x =  10, y =  20\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Whats the output of the following code?\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def calculate(a, b):\n",
    "    sum_val = a + b\n",
    "    diff_val = a - b\n",
    "    return sum_val, diff_val        \n",
    "result = calculate(10, 5)\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.5 Recursive Functions\n",
    "A recursive function is a function that calls itself in order to solve a problem. It is typically constructed with a base case that has a statement to stop the recursion and a recursive case to continue the recursion.\n",
    "- The base case is the condition to stop the recursion.\n",
    "- The recursive case is the part where the function calls on itself.\n",
    " \n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of a recursive function to calculate factorial\n",
    "def factorial(n):\n",
    "    if n == 0:\n",
    "        return 1  # Base case\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return n * factorial(n - 1)  # Recursive case\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursive functions can be very useful for small problems, such as calculating factorials or incrementing numbers, but they can also lead to performance issues if the recursion depth is too high. Python has a recursion limit (which can be checked and set using the `sys` module) to prevent infinite recursion from crashing the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.6 Implicit Arguments\n",
    "In Python, **methods defined within a class** automatically take the instance of the class as the first argument, conventionally named `self`. This allows methods to access and modify the instance's attributes. We will explore classes and objects in more detail in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of a class with a method using implicit arguments\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.name} says woof!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "dog = Dog(\"Buddy\")\n",
    "dog.bark()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.7 Keyword Arguments, *args, and **kwargs\n",
    "As we have seen previously, Python allows you to define functions that can accept a variable number of arguments using `*args` and `**kwargs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of a function using *args and **kwargs\n",
    "def example_function(*args, **kwargs):\n",
    "    for arg in args:\n",
    "        print(arg)\n",
    "    for key, value in kwargs.items():\n",
    "        print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "example_function(1, 2, 3, name=\"Alice\", age=30)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is very useful when you need to create functions that can handle a flexible number of inputs. This is very common in matplotlib, for example, where you can pass a variable number of arguments to customize plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Lambda Functions\n",
    "Lambda functions are small anonymous functions defined using the `lambda` keyword. They can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression. The expression is evaluated and returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of a lambda function\n",
    "add = lambda x, y: x + y\n",
    "result = add(5, 3)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions are often used in conjunction with functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`. The benefit of using lambda functions is that they allow you to write concise, inline functions without the need for a full function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of using a lambda function with sorted\n",
    "points = [(1, 2), (3, 1), (5, 4), (2, 3)]\n",
    "sorted_points = sorted(points, key=lambda point: point[1])\n",
    "print(sorted_points)  # Output: [(3, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (5, 4)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.1 Some useful built-in functions: Map() and Filter()\n",
    "There are some very useful built-in functions in Python like `map()` and `filter()` that can be used in conjunction with lambda functions to efficiently process collections of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance:\n",
    "- `map()` function: Applies a function to all items in an input list (or any iterable) and returns a map object (which can be converted to a list). A map object is an iterator that applies the function to each item of the iterable, yielding the results one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of using map with a lambda function\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "squared = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))\n",
    "print(squared)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `filter()` function: Filters items in an input list (or any iterable data structure) based on a function that returns `True` or `False`. Very useful to filter data based on some condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of using filter with a lambda function\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))\n",
    "print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4]\n",
