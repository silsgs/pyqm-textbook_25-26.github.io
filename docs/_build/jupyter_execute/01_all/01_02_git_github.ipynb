    "# Part 2. Basic Git and GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "Git client is  an open-source, version control tool that allows you to track changes in your code and collaborate with others. It is very useful for managing code in research projects, especially when working in teams. \n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides additional features for collaboration, such as issue tracking, pull requests, and code reviews. GitHub also provides a user-friendly interface for managing repositories and collaborating with others. There are other platforms similar to GitHub, such as GitLab and Bitbucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced usage of Git includes branching and merging, which allows multiple people to work on the same codebase without conflicts. However, for this course and your MSc project, we will only use the basic commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important as using Git helps developing good practices in coding, such as writing clear commit messages, using branches for new features or bug fixes, and regularly pushing changes to the remote repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "But also, it is extremely usefull for research as it promotes transparency and reproducibility. It allows others to access the code to replicate results, data analysis pipelines, etc. If you know about the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), using Git and a remote repository hosted in GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket, can help make your code more FAIR by providing a platform for sharing, collaborating on code and reproduce results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Basic Git commands\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first activate our virtual environment (if not already activated):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda activate pyqm\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For a quick reference of the most common Git commands, you can run on the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git --help\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Just in (the rare) case you need to reinstall Git, here are the instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install git \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For this course, we will use the following basic Git commands:\n",
    "- `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository in the current directory.\n",
    "- `git clone <repository-url>`: Clone an existing repository from a remote source (e.g., GitHub) to your local machine.\n",
    "- `git status`: Check the status of your working directory and see which files have been modified, added, or deleted.\n",
    "- `git add <file>`: Stage changes to a specific file for the next commit. You can also use `git add .` to stage all changes in the current directory.\n",
    "- `git commit -m \"commit message\"`: Commit the staged changes with a descriptive message.\n",
    "- `git push origin <branch>`: Push your local commits to the remote repository on the specified branch (e.g., `main` or `master`).\n",
    "- `git pull origin <branch>`: Fetch and merge changes from the remote repository to your local branch.\n",
    "- `git log`: View the commit history of the repository.\n",
    "- `git branch`: List all branches in the repository. You can also create a new branch with `git branch <branch-name>`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Intially, we won't use branches, but it is good to know that they exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "More information can be found here: https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/basic-git-commands-776639767.html\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 Create a GitHub account\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a GitHub account, follow these steps:\n",
    "1. Go to the GitHub website:  https://github.com/\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Click on the \"Sign up\" button located at the top right corner of the page.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. Fill in the required information, including your username, email address, and password.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. Choose a plan (the free plan is sufficient for most users).\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. Complete the account creation process by following the on-screen instructions, which may include verifying your email address.\n",
    "   \n",
    "6. Once your account is created, you can log in and start using GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.3 Create a new repository on GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "For this section we will be using the terminal. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a local git repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, open up a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you want to create your new Git repository. Then, run the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mkdir my-repo\n",
    "cd my-repo\n",
    "git init    \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add a new file to the repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a text editior of your choice, create a new file called `README.md` in the `my-repo` directory. Add some content to the file, such as a brief description of your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example using VIM: \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "vim README.md\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Press `i` to enter insert mode, type your content (e.g. \"This is a READ me test\"), then press `Esc`, type `:wq`, and press `Enter` to save and exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "or, \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo \"# My Repository\" >> README.md\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating the file, you can use git status to see the changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git status\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The last line will tell you that there is a file that has been added or modified, yet untracked by git. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Stage the file for commit:\n",
    "\n",
    "We then need to add the file to the staging area using the `git add` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git add README.md\n",
    "git status\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Commit the changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Comminting the changes to the repository means leaving a descriptive message of what has been changed. The more descriptive, the more usefull they will be for you and your collaborators. This is done using the `git commit` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git commit -m \"Initial commit with README file\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Push the changes to GitHub:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have committed your changes, you can push them to a remote repository on GitHub. Pushing the changes to GitHub means uploading the local repository to trhe remote repository on GitHub. \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git push origin main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we are assuming that the default branch is called `main`. In older versions of Git, the default branch was called `master`. If your default branch is called `master`, you should use `git push origin master` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.3 Create a new branch (optional):\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Git creates a branch called `main` (or `master` in older versions). You can create a new branch using the `git branch` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git branch my-branch\n",
    "git checkout my-branch\n",
    "git status\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This, will push the changes to the `my-branch` branch instead of the `main` branch. It is very useful when you don't want to change the main branch until you are sure that the changes are correct. This is especially useful when working in teams since it avoids conflicts between different people's changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.3.1 Merge branches (optional):\n",
    "Once you have made changes in a branch and you are satisfied with them, you can merge the changes back into the main branch using the `git merge` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git checkout main\n",
    "git merge my-branch\n",
    "git status\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.4 Pull changes from GitHub:\n",
    "Whether you are working alone or in a team, it is important to regularly pull changes from the remote repository to ensure that you have the latest version of the code. This is done using the `git pull` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git pull origin main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have followed the previous steps so far, now you should have a local repository with a `README.md` file, and the same repository should be available on GitHub. You can verify this by going to your GitHub account and checking if the repository is there.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.4 Clone a repository from GitHub:\n",
    "Cloning a repository means creating a local copy of a remote repository on your machine. For instance, there is a public program that you want to use (or contribute to), and it is hosted on GitHub. You can clone the repository to your local machine and work on it locally. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is very common specially in research fields which are in early-stages of developement, or fast developing, such as machine learning, computational chemistry, quantum computing. Many researchers share their code on GitHub, and you can clone the repository to your local machine and use it for your own research. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, few tips and warnings:\n",
    "- Always make sure to read the license of the repository before using it, as some repositories may have restrictions on how the code can be used. \n",
    "- Be aware that some repositories may not be well-maintained or may contain bugs, so it is important to test the code thoroughly before using it in your own research.\n",
    "- Public repositories may not be peer-reviewed, so use them with caution and verify their validity.\n",
    "- And finally, if you are making your work public, always remeber to cite the original authors if you use their code in your research! (You will apprciate if one day someone cites your code :D )\n",
    "\n",
    "To clone an existing repository from GitHub to your local machine, you can use the `git clone` command: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd /path/to/clone/directory \n",
    "git clone <repository-url>\n",
    "```\n",
    "This means, downloading a copy of a repository hosted at '<repository-url>' to your local machine. You can find the repository URL on the GitHub page of the repository you want to clone.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to good version control of your code, Git allows to contribute to an existing project that is already hosted on GitHub. It also allows for transoperatibility, as you can work on the same codebase from different machines. You can clone the repository to each machine and work on it locally. Just make sure to push your changes to the remote repository so that they are available on all machines!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.5 View commit history:\n",
    "To view the commit history of a repository, you can use the `git log` command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git log\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will display a list of all the commits in the repository, along with their commit messages, author information, and timestamps. You can use this information to track changes to the code over time and to identify specific commits that introduced bugs or other issues.\n",
