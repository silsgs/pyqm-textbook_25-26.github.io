    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Introduction to Numpy\n",
    "Numpy is a powerful library for numerical computations in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and a wide range of mathematical functions to operate on these data structures.\n",
    "The full official documentation for Numpy can be found [here](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Numpy Objects: N-dimensional Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy uses objects called arrays. They are **similar to Python lists but offer more functionality and are more efficient for numerical operations**. They are also **significantly faster** to use in computations than Python lists. The speed-up is that numpy arrays must contain elements of the same data type (homogeneous data structures), as opposed to python lists which can contain multiple different data types (heterogeneous data structures).\n",
    "\n",
    "Most NumPy arrays have some restrictions. For instance:\n",
    "- All elements of the array must be of the same type of data.\n",
    "- The shape must be “rectangular”, not “jagged”; e.g., each row of a two-dimensional array must have the same number of columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the word “array” to refer to an instance of ndarray.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we can create and manipulate arrays of any dimension by using the `np.array()` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "``arr = np.array(data, dtype)``\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np  \n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a 1D array from a list\n",
    "arr1d = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  \n",
    "print(\"\\nArray 1D:\\n \", arr1d)    \n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a 2D array from a list of lists\n",
    "arr2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])  \n",
    "print(\"\\nArray 2D:\\n\",arr2d)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a 2D array from a list of lists with a specified data type\n",
    "arr2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], dtype=float)  \n",
    "print(\"\\nArray 2D:\\n\", arr2d)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy also supports 0-dimensional arrays, however they are not very useful.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Creating a 0D array\n",
    "arr0d = np.array(42)  \n",
    "print(arr0d)\n",
    "print(arr0d.ndim) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Short exercise**: Create a 1D array, a 2D array, and a 3D array with different data types. 1D array with integers, 2D array with floats, and 3D array with complex numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Example here!\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases it can be useful to create arrays with specific type of floating point numbers. Numpy supports several floating point types, each with different precision and memory requirements. The most commonly data types in Numpy are:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Data Type | Description |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------|\n",
    "| int8     | 8-bit signed integer |\n",
    "| int16    | 16-bit signed integer |\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1.2.2 Array Indexing and Slicing\n",
    "There are some very useful methods to access and manage elements in a Numpy arrays. Some of the most commonly used techniques are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Indexing**: You can access individual elements of an array using their indices. Remember that Numpy uses zero-based indexing, so the first element has an index of 0. Indexes always are enclosed in square brackets `[]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "General syntax for indexing:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "arr[i]          # 1D array\n",
    "arr[i, j]       # 2D array\n",
    "arr[i, j, k]    # 3D array, where i, j, k are the indices of the elements you want to access.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Short exercise:**\n",
    "From the previous arrays you created, access the first element of the 1D array, the element in the first row and second column of the 2D array, and the element in the second block, first row, and second column of the 3D array.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Example here!\n",
    ":class: dropdown\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Accessing elements from the arrays created in the previous exercise\n",
    "first_element_1d = arr1d[0]\n",
    "element_2d = arr2d[0, 1]\n",
    "element_3d = arr3d[1, 0, 1]\n",
    "print(\"First element of 1D array:\", first_element_1d)\n",
    "print(\"Element in first row and second column of 2D array:\", element_2d)\n",
    "print(\"Element in second block, first row, and second column of 3D array:\", element_3d)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Slicing**: You can extract subarrays using slicing. For example, `arr[1:4]` extracts elements from index 1 to 3 in a 1D array, and `arr[0:2, 1:3]` extracts a subarray from the first two rows and columns 1 to 2 in a 2D array. \n",
    "\n",
    "General syntax for slicing:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "arr[start:stop:step]          # 1D array\n",
    "arr[start_row:stop_row, start_col:stop_col]  # 2D array\n",
    "arr[start_block:stop_block, start_row:stop_row, start_col:stop_col]  # 3D array\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Short exercise:** From the previous arrays you created, slice the first three elements of the 1D array, the first two rows and first two columns of the 2D array, and the first block, first two rows, and first two columns of the 3D array.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Example here!\n",
    ":class: dropdown\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Slicing elements from the arrays created in the previous exercise\n",
    "slice_1d = arr1d[0:3]\n",
    "slice_2d = arr2d[0:2, 0:2]\n",
    "slice_3d = arr3d[0:1, 0:2, 0:2]\n",
    "print(\"Sliced first three elements of 1D array:\\n\", slice_1d)\n",
    "print(\"Sliced first two rows and first two columns of 2D array:\\n\", slice_2d)\n",
    "print(\"Sliced first block, first two rows, and first two columns of 3D array:\\n\", slice_3d)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Boolean Indexing**: We can also use boolean arrays to index another array to match conditions. For example, `arr[arr > 5]` returns all elements in `arr` that are greater than 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Short exercise:** From any of previous arrays, use boolean indexing to get all elements greater than an arbitrary value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Example here!\n",
    ":class: dropdown\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Using boolean indexing to get elements greater than 3 from the 2D array\n",
    "bool_indexed_elements_2d = arr2d[arr2d > 3]\n",
    "print(\"Original 2D array:\\n\", arr2d)\n",
    "print(\"\\nElements greater than 3:\\n\", bool_indexed_elements_2d)\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fancy Indexing**: You can use arrays of indices to access multiple elements at once. For example, `arr[[0, 2, 4]]` returns the elements at indices 0, 2, and 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Short exercise:** Try creating a 1D array and using fancy indexing to access first, third, and fourth elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Example here!\n",
    ":class: dropdown\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Creating a 1D array\n",
    "arr1d = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using fancy indexing to access specific elements\n",
    "fancy_indexed_elements_1d = arr1d[[0, 2, 3]]\n",
    "print(\"Original 1D array:\\n\", arr1d)\n",
    "print(\"Elements at indices 0, 2, and 3:\\n\", fancy_indexed_elements_1d)\n",
