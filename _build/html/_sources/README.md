# Python For Quantum Mechanics

## Description

This is the online textbook for the course Introduction to Python for Quantum Mechanics. The course provides a practical introduction to Python programming, with a focus on both core and applied libraries relevant to Quantum Physics. It is designed to support students in developing the coding skills necessary to carry out your projects effectively.

The course covers essential scientific libraries and specialized quantum computation tools, such as Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib and Qutip. It also includes a short tutorial on conda virtual environment management and the basic use of Git for reliable version control of scripts and programs.

### Course goals

The main goals of this course are to:

- Develop a solid foundation in Python programming, basic skills in managing virtual environments using conda and using basic Git commands for effective version control and remote/local repository management.

- Gain practical knowledge of core scientific libraries, including NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib, essential for numerical computing, linear algebra and data visualization.

- Provide the fundamentals of Python libraries for quantum computation, with an introduction to QuTiP.

- Develop a critical perspective on AI-assisted programming tools, such as Copilot, understanding their benefits, limitations, and responsible use.
