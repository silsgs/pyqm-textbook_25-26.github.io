    "## 2.1 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts\n",
    "Classes and Objects in Python are at the core of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). They provide a way of bundling data and functionality all together. OOP permits the grouping of related **properties and behaviors into individual objects**. You can think of objects as real-world entities that have attributes (properties) and behaviors (methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "It also exists in other programming languages such as Java, C++, and Ruby, and it allows for:\n",
    "- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within one unit, e.g.: a class in Python.\n",
    "- **Inheritance**: Creating new classes based on previously existing classes, allowing for code reuse and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n"

    "### 2.1.1 Classes and instances\n",
    "Classes allow you to **create user-defined data structures** that **encapsulate data and functionality together**. By creating a new class, you create a new type of object, with functions (the same functions we saw in the previous section) which identify the behaviors and actions of the objects created from the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **instance** is a specific object created from a particular class. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an instance of the class is created. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of classes as categories of objects, and instances as the specific objects that belong to those categories. (For example, if we have a class called `Dog`, then an instance of that class could be a specific dog named \"Buddy\". We will see more examples below.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.2 Defining A Class\n",
    "Classes create new types of objects, and these objects can have attributes (data) associated with them, as well as behaviors. The behaviors are implemented as functions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ClassName:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, parameters):\n",
    "        # Initialization code here\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def method_name(self, parameters):\n",
    "        # Method code here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how we define a class:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name  # Attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def hello_method(self):  # Method\n",
    "        print(f\"Hello, {self.name}!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    # You can add more methods here\n",
    "    def goodbye_method(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Goodbye, {self.name}!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `MyClass` is a class with an `__init__` method (a special method called a constructor or magic method, which is called when an instance of the class is created) and a method called `hello_method`. The `self` parameter in the methods refers to the instance of the class itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name  # Attribute1\n",
    "        self.age = age    # Attribute2\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def bark(self):       # Method1\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.name} says Woof!\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def get_age(self):     # Method2\n",
    "        return self.age\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we define a class named `Dog` with an `__init__` method that initializes the `name` and `age` attributes, and two methods: `bark`, which prints a barking message, and `get_age`, which returns the age of the dog.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.3 Creating Instances of a Class\n",
    "To create an instance of a class, you call the class as if it were a function, passing any arguments that the `__init__` method requires. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_instance = MyClass(\"Alice\")\n",
    "my_instance.hello_method()  # Output: Hello, Alice!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create as many instances of a class as we want:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# First instance of Dog\n",
    "dog1 = Dog(\"Buddy\", 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Second instance of Dog\n",
    "dog2 = Dog(\"Max\", 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling methods on the instances\n",
    "dog1.bark()  # Output: Buddy says Woof!\n",
    "\n",
    "print(dog2.get_age())  # Output: 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.4 Attributes and Methods\n",
    "Attributes are variables that belong to an instance of a class. They are used to store data about the object. Methods are functions that belong to an instance of a class and can operate on the object's attributes.\n",
    "You can access attributes and methods using the dot (`.`) notation:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(dog1.name)  # Accessing attribute\n",
    "dog1.bark()       # Calling method\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the difference between calling attributes and methods. Attributes hold data related to the instance (dog1 and its name), and to access them we don't use `()`. While methods perform actions or operations (dog1 barks - think of this of a mathematical operation or transformation), and when calling them we do use `()`. This is because methods are functions, and functions can also make use of other arguments as we saw in the previous section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.5 The `__init__` Method\n",
    "The `__init__` method is a special method in Python classes. It is called when an instance (object) of the class is created. The purpose of the `__init__` method is to initialize the attributes of the new object. It is often referred to as the constructor of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a class with an `__init__` method:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name  # Initialize the name attribute\n",
    "        self.age = age    # Initialize the age attribute\n",
    "    def greet(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create an instance of the `Person` class, the `__init__` method is automatically called, and you can pass values for the `name` and `age` parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "person1 = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\n",
    "person1.greet()  # Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.6 Instance Variables and Class Variables\n",
    "We can find two types of variables in a class: \n",
    "- **Instance Variables**: These are variables that are unique to each instance of a class. They are defined within the `__init__` method and are prefixed with `self.` to indicate that they belong to the instance. Each instance of the class has its own copy of these variables.\n",
    "- **Class Variables**: These are variables that are shared among all instances of a class. They are defined within the class but outside of any methods. Class variables are accessed using the class name or through an instance.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    species = \"Canis familiaris\"  # Class variable\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name  # Instance variable\n",
    "        self.age = age    # Instance variable\n",
    "\n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.name} says Woof!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_age(self):\n",
    "        return self.age # Instance method\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating instances of the Dog class\n",
    "dog1 = Dog(\"Buddy\", 3)\n",
    "dog2 = Dog(\"Max\", 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(dog1.species)  # Accessing class variable via instance\n",
    "print(Dog.species)   # Accessing class variable via class name\n",
    "print(dog1.name)     # Accessing instance variable\n",
    "print(dog2.name)     # Accessing instance variable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.7 The `self` Parameter\n",
    "In Python, the `self` parameter in class methods refers to the instance of the class itself. It is used to access attributes and methods of the class within its own methods. When you define a method in a class, you must include `self` as the first parameter, even though you do not pass it explicitly when calling the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.name} says Woof!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_age(self):\n",
    "        return self.age\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an instance of the Dog class\n",
    "dog1 = Dog(\"Buddy\", 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling methods on the instance\n",
    "dog1.bark()  # Output: Buddy says Woof!\n",
    "print(dog1.get_age())  # Output: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.8 The `__str__` and `__repr__` Methods\n",
    "The `__str__` and `__repr__` methods are special methods in Python that define how instances of a class are represented as strings. They are useful for debugging and logging purposes.\n",
    "- The `__str__` method is intended to provide a \"pretty\" or user-friendly string representation of the object. It is called by the built-in `str()` function and by the `print()` function.\n",
    "- The `__repr__` method is intended to provide a more detailed and unambiguous string representation of the object, which can be used to recreate the object. It is called by the built-in `repr()` function and is used in the interactive interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __str__(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.name} is {self.age} years old.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __repr__(self):\n",
    "        return f\"Dog(name={self.name!r}, age={self.age!r})\" # !r calls repr() on the attribute  \n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an instance of the Dog class\n",
    "dog1 = Dog(\"Buddy\", 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(dog1)          # Calls __str__: Output: Buddy is 3 years old\n",
    "print(repr(dog1))    # Calls __repr__: Output: Dog(name='Buddy', age=3)\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2.2 Inheritance\n",
    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows a class (called the child or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (called the parent or superclass). This promotes code reuse and establishes a \n",
    "hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can inherit from a parent class by creating a new class and putting the parent class name in parentheses after the new class name. The child class will then inherit all the attributes and methods of the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Parent:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child(Parent):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        super().__init__(name)\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        raise NotImplementedError(\"Subclasses must implement this method.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.name} says Woof!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.name} says Meow!\"    \n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating instances of the Dog and Cat classes\n",
    "dog = Dog(\"Buddy\")\n",
    "cat = Cat(\"Whiskers\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(dog.speak())  # Output: Buddy says Woof!\n",
    "print(cat.speak())  # Output: Whiskers says Meow!\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can see that both `Dog` and `Cat` classes inherit from the `Animal` class. They both implement the `speak` method, which is defined as an abstract method in the `Animal` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.3 Operator Overloading\n",
    "Operator overloading allows you to define custom behavior for standard operators (like +, -, *, etc.) when they are used with instances of your classes. This is done by defining special methods in your class that correspond to the operators you want to overload.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to overload the `+` operator, you would define the `__add__` method in your class. Here is an example of a simple `Vector` class that overloads the `+` operator to add two vectors together:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Vector:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, x, y):\n",
    "        self.x = x\n",
    "        self.y = y\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __add__(self, other):\n",
    "        if isinstance(other, Vector):\n",
    "            return Vector(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)\n",
    "        return NotImplemented\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __repr__(self):\n",
    "        return f\"Vector({self.x}, {self.y})\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating instances of the Vector class\n",
    "v1 = Vector(2, 3)\n",
    "v2 = Vector(5, 7)\n",
    "\n",
    "v3 = v1 + v2  # This calls the __add__ method\n",
    "print(v3)  # Output: Vector(7, 10)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, we defined the `__add__` method to specify how two `Vector` instances should be added together using the `+` operator. When we use `v1 + v2`, it calls the `__add__` method, which returns a new `Vector` instance with the summed components.\n"
