    "# Part 1: Functions and Lambda Functions \n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, we will explore functions and lambda functions in Python. Functions are blocks of code, fundamental in programming, that perform specific tasks and can be reused throughout a program. They help in organizing code, improving readability, and reducing redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define our own functions to encapsulate logic and operations, making our code modular and easier to maintain.\n",
    "It is also very common to use Lambda functions for short, throwaway functions that are not reused elsewhere in the code.\n",
    "Lambda functions are a way to create small, anonymous functions in a single line of code. \n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between functions and lambda functions is that functions are defined using the `def` keyword and can contain multiple expressions and statements, while lambda functions are defined using the `lambda` keyword and can only contain a single expression. They provide a way to create small, anonymous functions on the fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Defining Functions\n",
    "Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. They help in **breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces**. If you remember from last week, algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving a problem. Functions can be thought of as a way to implement algorithms in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are useful to compactify code. Rather than writing 20 lines of code to do a specific task with certain values for the variables used, instead we define a function that we can call with different arguments and use it multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.1 Function Syntax\n",
    "In Python, a function is defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the **function name, parentheses `()`, and a colon `:`**. Remember the importance of syntax and indentation. The function body is indented below the definition line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax: \n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "def function_name([parameters]):\n",
    "    <block>\n",
    "    [return <expression>]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note a few things:\n",
    "- The function name should be descriptive and follow standard naming conventions (lowercase letters and underscores).\n",
    "- Parameters (also called arguments) are optional. A function can have zero or more parameters. \n",
    "- The `return` statement is also optional. If a function does not have a return statement, it returns `None` by default.\n",
    "- Indentation is crucial in Python, as it defines the scope of the function body.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.2 Function Arguments\n",
    "Functions can take arguments, which are values passed to the function when it is called. There are several types of arguments:\n",
    "- **Positional Arguments**: The most common type, where the order of arguments matters.\n",
    "- **Keyword Arguments**: Arguments that are passed by explicitly specifying the parameter name.\n",
    "- **Default Arguments**: Arguments that assume a default value if a value is not provided.\n",
    "- **Variable-length Arguments**: Arguments that allow you to pass a variable number of arguments to a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use positional and keyword arguments in a function call, all the positional arguments must come first. Otherwise, youâ€™ll get a syntax error:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of a function with default and positional arguments\n",
    "def greet(name, message=\"Hello\"):\n",
    "    print(f\"{message}, {name}!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of a function with keyword arguments\n",
    "def greet(name, message=\"Hello\"):\n",
    "    print(f\"{message}, {name}!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "greet(name=\"Alice\", message=\"Hi\")\n",
    "greet(name=\"Bob\")\n",
    "``` \n",
    "  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of a function with default arguments\n",
    "def greet(name, message=\"Hello\"):\n",
    "    print(f\"{message}, {name}!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "greet(\"Alice\")\n",
    "greet(\"Bob\", \"Hi\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of a function with variable-length arguments\n",
    "def print_numbers(*args):\n",
    "    for num in args:\n",
    "        print(num)\n",
    "print_numbers(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.3 Functions Returning a Value\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to save the output of a function, the common method is the  `return` statement. It can be used or not in a function, depending on whether you want to use the output of the function later in your code or not.\n",
    "Technical detail, if there is no `return` statement is used, the function returns `None` by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a function that returns a value:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of a function that returns a value\n",
    "def add(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "result = add(5, 3)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a function that does not return a value:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of a function that returns a value\n",
    "def add(a, b):\n",
    "    print(a + b)\n",
    "\n",
    "add(5, 3)\n",
    "result = add(5, 3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If then you try to print `result`, it will print `None` because the function does not return anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.4 Functions Returning Multiple Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can return multiple values by separating them with commas. The returned values are packed into a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of a function that returns multiple values\n",
    "def get_coordinates():\n",
    "    x = 10\n",
    "    y = 20\n",
    "    return x, y\n",
    "\n",
    "x, y = get_coordinates()\n",
    "print(x, y)  # Output: 10 20 \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Whats the output of the following code?\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def calculate(a, b):\n",
    "    sum_val = a + b\n",
    "    diff_val = a - b\n",
    "    return sum_val, diff_val        \n",
    "result = calculate(10, 5)\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.5 Recursive Functions\n",
    "A recursive function is a function that calls itself in order to solve a problem. It is typically constructed with a base case that has a statement to stop the recursion and a recursive case to continue the recursion.\n",
    "- The base case is the condition to stop the recursion.\n",
    "- The recursive case is the part where the function calls on itself.\n",
    " \n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of a recursive function to calculate factorial\n",
    "def factorial(n):\n",
    "    if n == 0:\n",
    "        return 1  # Base case\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return n * factorial(n - 1)  # Recursive case\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursive functions can be very useful for small problems, such as calculating factorials or incrementing numbers, but they can also lead to performance issues if the recursion depth is too high. Python has a recursion limit (which can be checked and set using the `sys` module) to prevent infinite recursion from crashing the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.6 Implicit Arguments\n",
    "In Python, methods defined within a class automatically take the instance of the class as the first argument, conventionally named `self`. This allows methods to access and modify the instance's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of a class with a method using implicit arguments\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.name} says woof!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "dog = Dog(\"Buddy\")\n",
    "dog.bark()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.7 Keyword Arguments, *args, and **kwargs\n",
    "Python allows you to define functions that can accept a variable number of arguments using `*args` and `**kwargs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of a function using *args and **kwargs\n",
    "def example_function(*args, **kwargs):\n",
    "    for arg in args:\n",
    "        print(arg)\n",
    "    for key, value in kwargs.items():\n",
    "        print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "example_function(1, 2, 3, name=\"Alice\", age=30)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is very useful when you need to create functions that can handle a flexible number of inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.8 Map, Filter, and Lambda Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides built-in functions like `map()` and `filter()` that can be used in conjunction with lambda functions to process collections of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `map()`: Applies a function to all items in an input list (or any iterable) and returns a map object (which can be converted to a list).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of using map with a lambda function\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "squared = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))\n",
    "print(squared)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `filter()`: Filters items in an input list (or any iterable) based on a function that returns `True` or `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of using filter with a lambda function\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))\n",
    "print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.9 Lambda Functions\n",
    "Lambda functions are small anonymous functions defined using the `lambda` keyword. They can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression. The expression is evaluated and returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of a lambda function\n",
    "add = lambda x, y: x + y\n",
    "result = add(5, 3)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions are often used in conjunction with functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`. The benefit of using lambda functions is that they allow you to write concise, inline functions without the need for a full function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of using a lambda function with sorted\n",
    "points = [(1, 2), (3, 1), (5, 4), (2, 3)]\n",
    "sorted_points = sorted(points, key=lambda point: point[1])\n",
    "print(sorted_points)  # Output: [(3, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (5, 4)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercises:\n",
    "1. Write a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all the numbers in the list.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def sum_of_list(numbers):\n",

    "    return [name for name, age in sorted(people, key=lambda person: person[1])]\n",
    "print(sort_by_age([(\"Alice\", 30), (\"Bob\", 25), (\"Charlie\", 35)]))  # Output: [\"Bob\", \"Alice\", \"Charlie\"]\n",
