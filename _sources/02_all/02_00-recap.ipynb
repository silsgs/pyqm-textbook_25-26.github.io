    "# Part 0. Review of Week 1\n",
    "\n",
    "As a quick review of what we covered in Week 1, we will briefly go over the most important aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0.1 Python and Conda recap\n",
    "First, we will just make sure that you have Python and Conda installed on your machine. We will also review how to create and manage Conda environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test if you have Python and Conda installed, you can run the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python --version\n",
    "conda --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will test if you your environment is set up correctly. You can do this by listing all the Conda environments you have on your machine:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda env list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will try to open a Jupyter Notebook in the folder you have your exercises from last week. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "jupyter notebook \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Could you? Did you remeber to activate your environment first? \n",
    "\n",
    "Reminder on how to activate your environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda activate your_environment_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0.2 Git and GitHub recap\n",
    "\n",
    "Git can feel a bit overwhelming at first, but it's a powerful tool for version control. Let's go trough the basic commands again and check if you created your GitHub repository for this course successfully. Rembember to check that you have created the repo both locally and online on GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check if git is configured correctly, you can run the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git --version\n",
    "git config --list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Check that your name and email are correct. If not, you can set them using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\n",
    "git config --global user.email \"    \n",
    "```\n",
    "You will also see a list of other configurations, including the url of your remote repository if you have set one up. `remote.origin.url`. \n",
    "\n",
    "These are the basic Git commands we will be using throughout the course:\n",
    "- `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository\n",
    "- `git clone <repository_url>`: Clone an existing repository\n",
    "- `git status`: Check the status of your repository\n",
    "- `git add <file_name>`: Stage changes for the next commit\n",
    "- `git commit -m \"commit message\"`: Commit staged changes with a message\n",
    "- `git push`: Push committed changes to a remote repository\n",
    "- `git pull`: Pull changes from a remote repository\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0.3 Python basics recap\n",
    "### 0.3.1 Variables and Data Types\n",
    "In Python, variables are used to store data. You can create a variable by simply assigning a value to it using the `=` operator. Python supports several data types, including integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.3.2 Basic Operations\n",
    "Python supports various basic operations, including arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), comparison operations (equal to, not equal to, greater than, less than), and logical operations (and, or, not).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.3.3 Strings\n",
    "Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in single or double quotes. You can perform various operations on strings, such as concatenation, slicing, and formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.3.4 Lists\n",
    "Lists are ordered collections of items that can be of different data types. You can create a list by enclosing items in square brackets `[]`. Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their content after creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.3.5 Tuples\n",
    "Tuples are similar to lists, but they are immutable, meaning their content cannot be changed after creation. You can create a tuple by enclosing items in parentheses `()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.3.6 Sets\n",
    "Sets are unordered collections of unique items. You can create a set by enclosing items in curly braces `{}` or by using the `set()` function. Sets are useful for performing mathematical set operations like union, intersection, and difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.3.7 Dictionaries\n",
    "Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs. You can create a dictionary by enclosing key-value pairs in curly braces `{}` with a colon `:` separating keys and values. Dictionaries are mutable and allow for fast lookups based on keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extra : Bash commands\n",
    "Here are some basic bash commands that might be useful when working in the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ls`: List files and directories in the current directory\n",
    "    - `ls -l`: List files and directories in long format, showing permissions, ownership, size, and modification date\n",
    "    - `ls -a`: List all files and directories, including hidden ones\n",
    "    - `ls -lrt`: List files and directories sorted by modification time, with the most recently modified files first\n",
    "    - `ls -lh`: List files and directories in long format with human-readable file sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "- `cd <directory_name>`: Change the current directory to the specified directory\n",
    "    - `cd ..`: Move up one directory level\n",
    "    - `cd ../..`: Move up two directory levels\n",
    "    - `cd ../../..`: Move up three directory levels, etc.\n",
    "    - `cd ~`: Move to the home directory\n",
    "\n",
    "- `cat <file_name>`: Print the content of a file\n",
    "    -  `cat | wc -l <file_name>` : Print number of lines in a file\n",
    "  \n",
    "- `pwd`: Print the current working directory\n",
    "- `mkdir <directory_name>`: Create a new directory with the specified name\n",
    "- `rm <file_name>`: Remove the specified file\n",
    "- `rm -r <directory_name>`: Remove the specified directory and its contents recursively\n",
    "- `cp <source> <destination>`: Copy a file or directory from source to destination\n",
    "- `mv <source> <destination>`: Move or rename a file or directory from source to destination\n",
    "- `du -sh <directory_name>`: Display the total size of the specified directory in a human-readable format\n",
    "\n",
    "Note about `rm` command: Be very careful when using the `rm` command, especially with the `-r` option, as it will permanently delete files and directories without moving them to a trash or recycle bin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note about path: In bash, you can use both absolute and relative paths to specify file and directory locations. An absolute path starts from the root directory (e.g., `/home/user/documents`), while a relative path is based on the current working directory (e.g., `documents` if you are already in the `user` directory).\n",
    "A relative path can also include `..` to move up one directory level (e.g., `../pictures` to access the `pictures` directory from the `documents` directory).\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to open a terminal and navigate to the folder where you have your exercises from last week. You can use the `ls` command to list the files and directories in the current directory, and the `cd` command to change directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bash cheat sheet: https://github.com/RehanSaeed/Bash-Cheat-Sheet\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extra : VIM editor\n",
    "Vim is a powerful text editor that can be used in the terminal. Here are some basic commands to help you get started with Vim: \n",
    "\n",
    "Basic Vim commands:\n",
    "- Typing in the terminal: `vim <file_name>` will open the specified file in Vim (terminal)\n",
    "- Once in Vim, press the following:\n",
    "    - `i`: Enter insert mode to start editing the file\n",
    "    - `Esc`: Exit insert mode and return to normal mode\n",
    "    - `:w`: Save the file\n",
    "    - `:q`: Quit Vim\n",
    "    - `:wq`: Save the file and quit Vim\n",
    "    - `:q!`: Quit Vim without saving changes\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to open a terminal and create a new file using Vim. You can use the `vim <file_name>` command to create and open a new file. Then, try to edit the file, save it, and quit Vim using the commands above. Then, you can use the `ls` command to check if the file was created successfully. If you want to keep practicing with Git, you can also try to stage and commit the new file using Git commands to push it to your GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you remember how to do it? If not, you can always go back to the Git section above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully this was a useful recap! If you have any questions or need further clarification on any of the topics covered, feel free to ask."
